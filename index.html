		<h3>Profile</h3>
		<p>
		I am a student currently studying at Informatics Institute of Technology. I have just successfully finished my second year and am now moving on to my third year. I am hard-working, curious and willing to learn and improve. I am especially enthusiastic about coding itself and building new programs or updating existing ones always interest me. While that is my main interest I am more than willing to broaden my horizons and try any new things that come my way. While it is true that I am still new, I will always go into any task or project sent my way with a drive and passion to learn and understand them completely and then finally finish them to the best of my knowledge.
